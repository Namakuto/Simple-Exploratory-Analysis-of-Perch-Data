# Simple-Exploratory-Analysis-of-Perch-Data
This was a basic exploratory analysis I performed on some old data I had from a course in biostatistics. The dataset is very small and simple; the purpose of this project/report was to simply showcase my data visualization abilities in R.

View the `RPerchreport-RMD.md` file to see my written up report/exploratory analyses of the dataset, including plot outputs (made in ggplot2).
